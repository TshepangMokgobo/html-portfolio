                <p>
                    01 April 2004 to 31 March 2005, was part of a learnership programme with Gestetner South Africa.
                    01 April 2005 to September 2005, worked as a workshop technician at Gestetner South Africa. Primary role being to refurbish the Gestetner Multifuntion printers for resale.
                    01 October 2005, was appointed as Junior field service engineer. It is in this role where I truly learned people skills and customer service. The role required me to install, service and demonstrate MFDs at the customer's premises.
                    I grew in the role to senior level where I transitioned more toward the networking side of things for the MFDs, the role I occupied for 15+ years. In December 2021, an opportunity became available and I was appointed a Product Support Specialist, focusing more on the print management solutions, i.e Kofax, Ricoh Streamline NX, PaperCut MF, and other solutions.
                    My current role is Team Leader: Service Desk at Ricoh South Africa.
